# SkinCare Builder – Personalized Skincare Routine App

## Overview
SkinCare Builder is a web application that helps users create personalized skincare routines.  
Users answer a short skin assessment questionnaire, and the system recommends routines based on skin type, concerns, lifestyle, and personal preferences.

Users can choose natural home remedies, commercial products, or a mixed approach. The app also adjusts routines based on seasons and checks ingredients for allergies.
